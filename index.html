  <p>Hey Nicky, this is my review of "The Force Awakens." I know you've already seen the movie twice, but here's a review.</p>

  <h2>Summary of the movie</h2>
  <p>The movie starts out the same as all of the other "Star Wars" movies, with the text flying up the screen. Then, some other things happen that I can't remember, and there's a black Stormtrooper, Finn, which is cool, but he doesn't want to be a Stormtrooper anymore, which is also cool. So he runs away.</p>
  <p>Then there's this girl, Rey, who lives in a desert or something and she has three buns on her head (which is totally a play on Princess Laya's original buns). Oh I forgot about the pilot, Poe, and BB8, the driod. Long story short, the pilot doesn't make it and BB8 finds Rey and they become BFFs.</p>
  <p> Then Rey and Finn team up to get BB8 home because he has a map to Luke Skywalker and it's all cool because they meet Han Solo and Chewy and then they go see General Leia.</p>
  <p>A lot more things happen to the crew on their journey. Rey is kidnapped by Kylo Ren so Fin and the crew go to rescue her, but she has pretty much already resuced herself by using the force. Oh, and it turns out Poe isn't dead after all.</p>
  <p>I really enjoyed this movie. It was action-packed and hit all the feels. I think you should go see it for a 3<sup>rd</sup> time.</p>
